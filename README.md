# eventlistener-intellisense README

Event-listener intellisense provides a small yet useful list of event listeners for the .on method in JQquery.

## Features

Type  '.on(' in any JS supported document to get a list of events to listen for. Should speed up coding a bit.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
